# The Team Data Science Process using Azure Machine Learning

This hands-on lab guides you through using the [Team Data Science Process](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/team-data-science-process/overview) (TDSP) using [Azure Machine Learning](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/preview/overview-what-is-azure-ml) (AML). We will be using a [Customer Churn Analysis example](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/preview/scenario-churn-prediction) throughout this Workshop (which we will download in a lab below).

In this lab, you will:
- [ ] Understand and use the TDSP to clearly define business goals and success criteria
- [ ] Understand how to use a code-repository system with AML using the TDSP structure
- [ ] Create an example environment
- [ ] Use the TDSP and AML for data acquisition and understanding
- [ ] Use the TDSP and AML for creating an experiment with a model and evaluation of models
- [ ] Use the TDSP and AML for deployment
- [ ] Use the TDSP and AML for project close-out and customer acceptance

You'll focus on the objectives above, not Data Science, Machine Learning or a difficult scenario.  

***NOTE:*** There are several pre-requisites for this course, including an understanding and implementation of: 
  *  Programming using an Agile methodology
  *  Machine Learning and Data Science
  *  Working with the Microsoft Azure Portal

There is a comprehensive Learning Path you can use to prepare for this course [located here](https://github.com/Azure/learnAnalytics-CreatingSolutionswiththeTeamDataScienceProcess-/blob/master/Instructions/Learning%20Path%20-%20Creating%20Solutions%20with%20the%20Team%20Data%20Science%20Process.md).

## Introduction and setup 

[The Primary Concepts for this lab are here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/preview/scenario-churn-prediction). We'll refer to these throughout the lab.

Please see this [file](../lab03.0-bootcamp-pre-requisites/0_README.md) for additional pre-requisites.

## Introduction to the TDSP

## 1. Business Understanding

In the [Business Understanding](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/team-data-science-process/lifecycle-business-understanding) phase of the TDSP, you discover the questions that the organization would like answered from data. This is a group effort, involving the organization, the Data Science team, and the DevOps team along with other stakeholders. 

Your scenario is as follows: 

The Orange Telecom company in France is one of the largest operators of mobile and internet services in Europe and Africa and a global leader in corporate telecommunication services. They have 256 million customers worldwide. They have significant coverage in France, Spain, Belgium, Poland, Romania, Slovakia Moldova, and a large presence Africa and the Middle East.
Customer Churn is always an issue in any company. Orange would like to predict the propensity of customers to switch provider (churn), buy new products or services (appetency), or buy upgrades or add-ons proposed to them to make the sale more profitable (up-selling). For this effort, they think churn is the first thing they would like to focus on. 

In this lab, you will use Azure Machine Learning (AML) to create a solution. The general configuration for working with Azure Machine Learning has these components:

### Lab: Set up a generic TDSP Structure using Azure Machine Learning

In this section you'll set up your project's structure, conforming to the Team Data Science Process, using Azure Machine Learning.
- [ ] [Open this link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/preview/how-to-use-tdsp-in-azure-ml), read from the top and complete the steps there. Do not complete the steps marked **"Next Steps"**. 
- [ ] [Review this link](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-TDSP-ProjectTemplate) and verify that you have the structure shown in the directory you specified. You will use this structure throughout this lab.

### Lab: Use-case evaluation for Data Science questions

In this section you'll evaluate a business scenario, and detail possible predictions, classifications, or other data science questions that you can begin to explore.
- [ ] Read the scenario above carefully. You can optionally copy and paste the scenario text below into a new text file called *Business Understanding.md* in the /docs directory set up in the previous section. After class discussion, you can enter the answers to the following questions in this document.
- [ ] Is this something that you can use a Machine Learning system for a solution?  
- [ ] Which algorithm or family of algorithms could you use to answer your question?
- [ ] What data source(s) will you need to complete your prediction? 
- [ ] How will the users interact with the solution?

## 2. Data Acquisition and Understanding

The [Data Aquisition and Understanding](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/team-data-science-process/lifecycle-data) phase of the TDSP you ingest or access data from various locations to answer the questions the organization has asked. In most cases, this data will be in multiple locations. 
Once the data is ingested into the system, you'll need to examine it to see what it holds. All data needs cleaning, so after the inspection phase, you'll replace missing values, add and change columns. You'll cover more extensive Data Wrangling tasks in other labs. 

In this section, we'll use a single file-based dataset to train our model.

### Lab: Ingest data from a local source

In this lab you will load the data set, inspect it, make a few changes, and then save the Data Wrangling steps as a Python package. 

- [ ] Open [this reference](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningSamples-ChurnPrediction/blob/master/docs/DataPreparation.md) and follow the steps you see there.

## 3. Modeling

The [Modeling](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/team-data-science-process/lifecycle-modeling) phase of the Team Data Science Process involves creating experiments using one or more algorithms and base data to create a repeatable prediction or classification. 

  * You'll begin by using the `sklearn` library with Na√Øve Bayesian and Decision Tree algorithms to develop a churn classifier, do an evaluation, and compare the models.
  * Finally, after the experiments run, you'll score the models to select the best one.

A view of this process is here, shown on the *right* side of the Docker graphic:

### Lab: Feature Engineering, Modeling, and Scoring

In this lab we'll use the same project you just created. You'll create your feature engineering file, run the model training, and create the final scores.
- [ ] [Navigate to this resource](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningSamples-ChurnPrediction/blob/master/docs/ModelingAndEvaluation.md), and complete the steps 1-4. 

## 4. Deployment

A view of this process is here, shown on the *left* side of the Docker graphic: 

![Image](resources/docs/images/aml-architecture-2.png)

The [Deployment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/team-data-science-process/lifecycle-deployment) phase of the TDSP entails outputting  the results to a data location, creating an Application Programming Interface (API) or another mechanism for the classification or prediction model to be consumed. 

### Optional Lab: Deploy the solution using Containers, consume the results

In this lab you will deploy the solution locally, and optionally to Docker.  **NOTE** This section takes quite some, so it's included here for completeness. The instructor will go over it with you. 

- [ ] [Navigate to this resource](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningSamples-ChurnPrediction/blob/master/docs/ModelingAndEvaluation.md), and complete the steps 5-8. 

## 5. Customer Acceptance

The final step in the Team Data Science Process is [Customer Acceptance](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/team-data-science-process/lifecycle-acceptance). Here you focus on ensuring that the model performed within acceptable time and accuracy rates, and also present your findings in a comprehensive project document.
### Lab: Review Customer Acceptance and Closeout Documentation

In this lab you will examine the final project close out document. In production implementations, you and your team will create this document. 
- [ ] [Navigate to this resource](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningSamples-TDSPUCIAdultIncome/blob/master/docs/deliverable_docs/ProjectReport.md) and evalaute the report you see there. This is what you would create as a deliverable for your project.
- [ ] Is there additional information needed there? Are there items you would also include? How should this document be communicated? Are there security implications?

## Lab completion

In this lab you learned how to:
- [ ] Understand and use the TDSP to clearly define business goals and success criteria
- [ ] Understand how to use a code-repository system with Azure Machine Learning using the TDSP structure
- [ ] Create an example environment
- [ ] Use the TDSP and AML for data acquisition and understanding
- [ ] Use the TDSP and AML for creating an experiment with a model and evaluation of models
- [ ] Use the TDSP and AML for deployment

You may now delete and decommission the following resources if you wish:
  * Azure Machine Learning accounts and workspaces
  * The Visual Studio Team Services Repository
  * Any Data Science Virtual Machines you have created. NOTE: Even if "Shutdown" in the Operating System, unless these Virtual Machines are "Stopped" using the Azure Portal you are incurring run-time charges. If you Stop them in the Azure Portal, you will be charged for the storage the Virtual Machines are consuimg.
